                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">The E-Certificate platform is designed to facilitate event management, participant registration, attendance tracking, and digital certificate issuance. While we strive to ensure that all information displayed on the Service is accurate, current, and complete, we cannot guarantee that errors or omissions will not occur.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Information regarding events, schedules, venues, speakers, content, requirements, and other event-related details are provided by event organizers. We act as a technology platform and are not responsible for verifying the accuracy of information submitted by event organizers. Participants should independently verify critical event information directly with event organizers before making travel arrangements or other commitments.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Certificate Authenticity & Verification Disclaimer</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2.1 Nature of Digital Certificates</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">All certificates generated through this platform are digital representations of attendance or achievement at events. These certificates are created based on attendance records, event participation data, and information provided by event organizers and participants. While we employ robust security measures including unique certificate numbers, cryptographic verification, and audit trails to ensure certificate authenticity, we cannot guarantee that certificates will be accepted for all purposes or by all institutions.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2.2 Certificate Validity & Acceptance</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">The validity, recognition, and acceptance of certificates issued through our platform for professional licensing, continuing education credits, academic requirements, employment purposes, or other official uses are determined solely by the receiving institution, licensing board, employer, or regulatory authority. We make no representations or warranties regarding whether certificates will be accepted for any particular purpose.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Event organizers are responsible for ensuring that their events meet the requirements of relevant professional bodies, licensing authorities, or educational institutions. Participants should confirm with their licensing board, employer, or educational institution whether certificates from specific events will be accepted before registering.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2.3 Certificate Content Accuracy</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Certificate content, including participant names, event titles, dates, duration, and other details, are generated based on data provided by participants and event organizers. While we implement validation mechanisms and data verification processes, we are not responsible for errors arising from incorrect information provided by users. Participants are responsible for ensuring that their profile information (name, IC number, organization) is accurate before certificates are generated.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2.4 Verification Responsibility</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Entities that receive certificates (employers, licensing boards, educational institutions) are responsible for independently verifying certificate authenticity using the unique certificate number and verification features provided. While we maintain certificate records and provide verification tools, we cannot be held liable if recipients fail to properly verify certificates or if fraudulent certificates are created outside our system.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Attendance & GPS Location Disclaimer</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3.1 GPS Accuracy</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">When GPS location tracking is enabled for attendance verification, we record coordinates provided by your device's GPS system. GPS accuracy can vary significantly based on multiple factors including device quality, satellite visibility, atmospheric conditions, indoor/outdoor location, and local interference. GPS coordinates may be accurate to within 5-50 meters or more in challenging conditions.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">We do not guarantee the precision or accuracy of GPS coordinates. Location data is used as one verification factor among others (timestamps, QR codes, participant confirmation) and should not be considered definitive proof of exact physical location. Event organizers using GPS verification accept this inherent variability in location accuracy.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3.2 Attendance Verification Limitations</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Our attendance tracking system records check-in and check-out times, QR code scans, and GPS coordinates (when enabled). While these mechanisms significantly reduce fraudulent attendance claims, they are not foolproof. Determined bad actors may find ways to circumvent attendance verification systems. Event organizers should implement additional verification measures for high-stakes certifications or critical compliance training.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">We are not responsible for fraudulent attendance records created through system manipulation, collusion between participants, or other deceptive practices. Our role is to provide tools; event organizers bear ultimate responsibility for ensuring attendance integrity.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3.3 Technical Failures</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">GPS systems, QR code scanners, and network connectivity can fail due to technical issues, device limitations, or environmental factors. We are not liable for inability to record attendance due to device malfunctions, network outages, GPS unavailability, camera failures, or other technical problems beyond our control. Participants experiencing technical difficulties should notify event organizers immediately for manual attendance recording.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. External Links Disclaimer</h2>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">The Service may contain links to external websites, services, or resources that are not provided, maintained, or controlled by E-Certificate. These links are provided for your convenience and informational purposes only. We have no control over the content, privacy policies, practices, or availability of third-party websites.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">We do not endorse, warrant, or assume responsibility for the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or legality of content on external websites. Your interactions with third-party websites are governed solely by the terms and privacy policies of those websites. We encourage you to review the terms and privacy policies of any third-party websites you visit.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Clicking on external links is at your own risk. We shall not be liable for any damages or losses arising from your access to or reliance on external websites, including but not limited to malware infections, data breaches, fraudulent schemes, or misleading information encountered on third-party sites.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Professional & Educational Disclaimer</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5.1 Not Professional Advice</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">The Service provides event management and certificate issuance technology. We do not provide professional advice (legal, medical, financial, educational, or otherwise). Event content, materials, presentations, and educational resources are created and delivered by event organizers and speakers, not by E-Certificate.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Attendance at events and receipt of certificates does not constitute professional certification, licensure, or qualification unless explicitly stated by the event organizer and recognized by relevant professional bodies. Participants should independently verify whether events meet requirements for their profession, license, or educational goals.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5.2 Continuing Education & Professional Development</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Many professionals use our Service to track Continuing Professional Development (CPD), Continuing Legal Education (CLE), Continuing Medical Education (CME), or similar ongoing education requirements. We provide tools to record and document attendance, but we do not verify or certify that specific events meet the requirements of professional licensing boards or regulatory authorities.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">It is the participant's sole responsibility to confirm with their licensing board, professional association, or regulatory body that certificates from events will be accepted for credit. Event organizers are responsible for obtaining accreditation or approval from relevant professional bodies if they claim to offer qualifying continuing education credits.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5.3 Academic Credit Disclaimer</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Certificates issued through our platform do not automatically confer academic credit unless the event is officially recognized and credit-granting authority has been established by an accredited educational institution. Students seeking academic credit must verify with their institution whether attendance certificates will be accepted.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">6.1 General Limitations</h3>

                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">These limitations apply regardless of the legal theory upon which the claim is based (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">6.2 Maximum Liability</h3>

For free services, our maximum liability shall not exceed RM100 (one hundred Malaysian Ringgit).</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Service Availability & Maintenance Disclaimer</h2>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">We do not guarantee, represent, or warrant that the Service will be available, accessible, uninterrupted, timely, secure, accurate, complete, or error-free at all times. The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li><strong>Scheduled Maintenance:</strong> Routine system updates, database optimization, security patches, and feature deployments may require temporary Service downtime</li>

                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) at any time, with or without notice, for any reason. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">In the event of Service unavailability during critical periods (event check-in times, certificate downloads, registration deadlines), we will make reasonable efforts to restore Service as quickly as possible, but we cannot guarantee any specific timeframe for restoration and are not liable for consequences arising from Service downtime.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">8.1 User-Provided Data</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">The accuracy and completeness of data in our system depends entirely on information provided by users (participants, event organizers, administrators). Users are solely responsible for ensuring that all information they submit—including personal details (names, IC numbers, passport numbers, addresses), event information, attendance records, and certificate content—is accurate, current, and complete.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">We are not responsible for consequences arising from inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated information provided by users.

                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">While we implement industry-standard security measures including SSL/TLS encryption, password hashing, access controls, and regular security audits, we cannot guarantee absolute security. No method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Cyberattacks, sophisticated hacking attempts, zero-day vulnerabilities, or insider threats could potentially compromise data security despite our best efforts.</p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Refund policies are set by individual event organizers, not by E-Certificate. We do not guarantee refunds for any events.

                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Event organizers are solely responsible for ensuring their events comply with applicable laws, regulations, licensing requirements, health and safety standards, accessibility requirements, and other legal obligations.

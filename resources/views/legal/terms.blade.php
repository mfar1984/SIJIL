                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2.2 Account Creation Requirements</h3>
                <p class="mb-3 text-sm">When creating an account, you must:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li>Provide accurate, complete, and current information including your full legal name, valid email address, phone number, and identity card or passport number</li>

                    <li>Provide truthful professional information (organization, job title) that you are authorized to represent</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Providing false, misleading, or fraudulent information constitutes a material breach of these Terms and may result in immediate account termination, certificate revocation, and potential legal action. We reserve the right to verify identity information and reject registrations we believe to be fraudulent.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2.3 Account Security & Password Management</h3>
                <p class="mb-3 text-sm">You are solely responsible for:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li>Safeguarding your account password and keeping it confidential</li>
                    <li>Creating strong passwords (minimum 6 characters, recommended 12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols)</li>
                    <li>Not sharing your password with others or allowing others to access your account</li>
                    <li>Logging out from shared or public devices after using the Service</li>
                    <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized account access or security breaches</li>
                    <li>All activities that occur under your account, whether authorized by you or not</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">We implement password hashing (bcrypt) and account lockout mechanisms (after multiple failed login attempts) for security. However, we are not liable for unauthorized account access resulting from password sharing, weak passwords, phishing attacks, or compromised credentials due to user negligence.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2.4 Account Restrictions</h3>
                <p class="mb-3 text-sm">You may not:</p>

                    <li>Create multiple accounts for the same person to circumvent restrictions or obtain duplicate benefits</li>
                    <li>Share accounts with multiple individuals or create shared/generic accounts (except organizational accounts with proper authorization)</li>
                    <li>Sell, transfer, rent, or otherwise provide access to your account to third parties</li>
                    <li>Use automated systems, bots, or scripts to create accounts, register for events, or interact with the Service</li>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3.1 Event Registration Process</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Event registration through our platform creates a binding commitment between you and the event organizer (not E-Certificate). When you register for an event via web form, mobile PWA, or QR code link, you:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li>Agree to attend the event at the specified date, time, and venue</li>
                    <li>Acknowledge that you have read and understood the event description, requirements, schedule, and venue information</li>
                    <li>Consent to receive event-related communications (confirmations, reminders, updates) via email and SMS</li>
                    <li>Accept the event organizer's specific event terms, cancellation policies, and code of conduct (if applicable)</li>
                    <li>Authorize the event organizer to contact you using the information you provided</li>
                    <li>Understand that registration may be subject to organizer approval and is not always guaranteed</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3.2 Event Capacity & Waitlists</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Events may have participant capacity limits. Registration does not guarantee entry if capacity is reached. Event organizers may implement first-come-first-served policies, waitlists, approval processes, or priority systems. We are not responsible for denial of entry due to capacity constraints or organizer selection criteria.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3.3 Event Changes & Cancellations</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Event organizers reserve the right to modify event details (dates, times, venues, speakers, content, format) or cancel events due to circumstances including but not limited to low registration numbers, speaker unavailability, venue issues, weather conditions, or force majeure events. While we provide notification tools, event organizers are responsible for communicating changes to participants.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">We are not liable for expenses, inconveniences, or losses you incur due to event changes or cancellations, including non-refundable travel bookings, accommodation costs, time off work, or opportunity costs. Refund policies are determined solely by event organizers, not by E-Certificate.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3.4 Participant Conduct</h3>
                <p class="mb-3 text-sm">When participating in events, you agree to:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li>Behave professionally, respectfully, and courteously toward other participants, speakers, organizers, and venue staff</li>
                    <li>Comply with event organizer's rules, codes of conduct, dress codes, and venue policies</li>
                    <li>Not disrupt events through harassment, aggressive behavior, excessive noise, or other inappropriate conduct</li>
                    <li>Respect intellectual property rights of speakers and presenters (no unauthorized recording, photographing, or redistribution of content)</li>
                    <li>Attend events you registered for or cancel with reasonable notice if unable to attend</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Violation of conduct standards may result in removal from events, account suspension, and prohibition from future events. Event organizers have sole discretion to enforce conduct policies.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Attendance Verification & GPS Tracking</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">4.1 QR Code Attendance System</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Our platform provides QR code-based attendance tracking. Event organizers generate unique QR codes for attendance sessions. Participants scan these codes using the mobile PWA scanner or manually enter attendance codes. By using the attendance system, you agree that:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li>QR codes are for your personal use only and must not be shared, photographed for others, or used to record proxy attendance</li>
                    <li>Each participant must personally scan their own attendance code at the physical event location</li>
                    <li>Scanning attendance codes on behalf of absent participants constitutes fraud and is grounds for certificate revocation and account termination</li>
                    <li>Attendance codes are time-sensitive and venue-specificâ€”codes may only be scanned during designated time windows</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">4.2 GPS Location Verification</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">When you use the mobile PWA attendance scanner, the system requests permission to access your device's GPS location. By granting location permission, you explicitly consent to:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li>Collection of your precise GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) at the moment of check-in and check-out</li>
                    <li>Storage of GPS coordinates in our database linked to your attendance record</li>
                    <li>Event organizers accessing your GPS data to verify physical presence at event venue</li>
                    <li>Use of GPS data as evidence of attendance authenticity for certificate validation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">You may deny location permission, but event organizers may require GPS verification for attendance validity. Events with mandatory GPS verification may flag non-GPS attendance for manual review or may not issue certificates for attendance recorded without GPS confirmation.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">You agree not to use GPS spoofing, fake location apps, VPNs with location masking, or other technological means to falsify your location during attendance check-in. Such actions constitute fraud and will result in certificate revocation, account termination, and potential legal action.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">4.3 Attendance Accuracy</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">You acknowledge that attendance records (check-in/check-out times, session participation, total duration) are used to determine certificate eligibility. Many events require minimum attendance thresholds (e.g., 75% attendance) for certificate issuance. You are responsible for ensuring you meet attendance requirements.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Late check-ins, early check-outs, or missed sessions may affect certificate eligibility or may be noted on certificates (e.g., "partial attendance"). Attendance status determinations (on-time, late, absent) are final and based on system-recorded timestamps compared to session start times.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Digital Certificates</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5.1 Certificate Generation</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Digital certificates are automatically or manually generated by event organizers based on attendance records, event participation, and organizer-defined criteria. Certificate generation is at the sole discretion of event organizers. We provide the technology platform but do not make decisions about who receives certificates or what certificates contain.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Certificates include your name (as provided in your profile), event name, event date(s), certificate number (unique identifier), issuance date, and may include additional information such as organization, job title, IC number (last 4 digits), attendance duration, or achievement details as determined by the event organizer.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5.2 Certificate Ownership & Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Certificates are the intellectual property of the event organizer who issued them. Event organizers retain all rights to certificate designs, templates, logos, branding, and content. You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to download, store, print, and present your personal certificates for legitimate purposes (employment verification, license renewal, academic records).</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3 text-sm">You may not:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li>Modify, alter, edit, or manipulate certificates in any way</li>
                    <li>Remove watermarks, certificate numbers, security features, or organizer information</li>
                    <li>Create derivative works or templates based on certificates</li>
                    <li>Claim certificates issued to others as your own</li>
                    <li>Sell, transfer, or provide your certificates to others for fraudulent use</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5.3 Certificate Validity & Verification</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Each certificate includes a unique certificate number in the format CERT-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-XXXXX for authentication purposes. This number can be used by employers, licensing boards, or educational institutions to verify certificate authenticity with the issuing event organizer.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Certificate validity, recognition, and acceptance for professional licensing, continuing education credits, academic requirements, or employment purposes are determined solely by the receiving institution or regulatory authority. We make no representations regarding certificate acceptance and you should verify acceptance requirements independently before relying on certificates for professional or academic purposes.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5.4 Certificate Revocation</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Certificates may be revoked by event organizers or system administrators if:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm">
                    <li>Attendance fraud is discovered (proxy attendance, GPS spoofing, QR code sharing)</li>
                    <li>Participant provided false information during registration</li>
                    <li>Participant violated event code of conduct or was removed from the event</li>
                    <li>Minimum attendance requirements were not actually met due to data errors</li>
                    <li>Certificate was issued in error or contains incorrect information</li>
                    <li>Participant requests certificate withdrawal</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Upon revocation, certificate files may be deleted from your account and verification systems will reflect revocation status. You must discontinue use of revoked certificates immediately and notify entities to whom you previously presented the certificate.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Mobile Progressive Web App (PWA)</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">6.1 PWA Functionality</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Our mobile PWA provides app-like functionality including offline access, push notifications, home screen installation, and device integration features. The PWA requires modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox) with JavaScript enabled and support for service workers, local storage, and web APIs.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">PWA features depend on device capabilities and permissions. By using the PWA, you agree to grant necessary permissions including camera access (for QR scanning), GPS location (for attendance verification), notification permissions (for event alerts), and local storage (for offline data caching). Denying permissions may limit functionality.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">6.2 Camera Access for QR Scanning</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">The PWA scanner feature uses your device camera to scan QR codes for attendance check-in. Camera access is requested only when you navigate to the scanner page. We do not record video, take photographs (beyond QR code recognition), or access your photo gallery. Camera access is used exclusively for real-time QR code scanning and no images are stored.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">6.3 Push Notifications</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">If you enable push notifications, we may send notifications about upcoming events, event changes, certificate availability, password resets, and important system announcements using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). You can disable notifications through device settings or PWA settings at any time. We do not send marketing notifications without explicit consent.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">6.4 Offline Functionality</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-sm">The PWA uses service workers to cache certain data for offline access. Cached data may include previously viewed events, downloaded certificates, and profile information. Offline functionality is limitedâ€”certain features (new registrations, attendance scanning, certificate downloads) require internet connectivity. We are not liable for data loss if cached data is cleared or if offline functionality fails.</p>
